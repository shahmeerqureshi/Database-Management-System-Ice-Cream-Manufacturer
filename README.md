# Database Management System: Ice Cream Manufacturer
This is a repository for the Database Management System: Ice Cream Manufacturer project, which is a database management system developed using SQLite. The system is designed to assist an ice cream manufacturer in managing their inventory and order fulfillment process efficiently and accurately.

## Features

#### Database Design and Implementation:
The system demonstrates proficiency in database design and implementation techniques. It provides a well-structured and organized database schema specifically tailored for the needs of an ice cream manufacturer.

#### Advanced SQL Queries:
The system utilizes advanced SQL queries to organize and manipulate data effectively. These queries ensure accurate management of the manufacturer's inventory and streamline the order fulfillment process.

#### XML and XSLT Integration: 
The system incorporates XML and XSLT technologies for handling semi-structured data. This integration facilitates seamless communication and data exchange between different components of the database system.

## Prerequisites
Before using the Database Management System: Ice Cream Manufacturer, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

SQLite: Installation Guide
XML and XSLT libraries: XML Library Installation Guide (if applicable)

## Installation
To get started with the Database Management System: Ice Cream Manufacturer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: https://github.com/shahmeerqureshi/Database-Management-System-Ice-Cream-Manufacturer.git

2. Navigate to the project directory: cd ice-cream-manufacturer-db

3. Set up the database:
    If you already have an SQLite database file, place it in the project directory.
    If not, run the provided SQL script to create the initial database structure:
    sqlite3 ice_cream.db < create_database.sql

4. Start the database management system: sqlite3 ice_cream.db

5. You are now ready to use the Database Management System: Ice Cream Manufacturer

## Usage
1. Launch the SQLite command-line interface by running the following command: sqlite3 ice_cream.db

2. Execute SQL queries to interact with the database and perform various operations, such as:
* Adding or updating ice cream flavors and their quantities
* Managing customer orders and tracking fulfillment status
* Generating reports on inventory levels, sales, and other relevant data
